        <h3>How Many Fish Per Aquarium?</h3>
        <br>
	<br>
        <p>Great question! Many new fish owners are concerned with over-stocking their new aquariums with too many fish. A good rule of thumb is 1 inch of fish per gallon of aquarium. That means you could put five 2-inch fish in a 10 gallon tank or ten 2-inch fish in a 20 gallon tank. <br><br>The important thing to look at is what size your fish will be when fully grown! A fish might look small in the store but grow to be 5+ inches fully grown!</p>

        <h3>Getting Started with Aquarium Plants</h3>
        <br>
	<br>
        <pLive plants in your aquarium is a great way to take your fish keeping skills to the next level and add a natural look to your tank! <br><br> The first step is to choose your plants. Any of the plants we have for sale are perfect for beginners! <br><br>
Next, you can use a variety of substrates for the bottom of your tank. The best substrate is something that contains fertilizer for the plants, however, it is not required. <br><br> Good Lighting! Proper lighting is very important for healthy plants. There are several good aquarium lights on Amazon. We recommend selecting something that fits your tank properly and checking reviews to make sure it works well for plants.

        <h3>How Do I Treat My Sick Fish?</h3>
        <br>
	<br>
        <p>Whenever your fish is acting strange or not like their usual selves, there are a few things you can do.<br><br> The first thing to do is test your water quality. Poor quality water can harm your fish and make them more prone to illness. Water testing strips are a good, quick way to test your water quality. <br><br> Next, perform a water change, removing about 20% of the water in your aquarium and replacing it with fresh water. <br><br> Then, the next step really depends on the type of fish you have and the symptoms they are showing. Ich can look like tiny white bumps for example. Many fish diseases are treatble and medications can be found at plenty of fish stores. </p>
